          The U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit and Climate Explorer are managed by NOAA's Climate Program Office, and hosted by NOAA's National Centers for
          Environmental Information (NCEI-Asheville).
        </p>
        <p>
          Development of this version of the Climate Explorer was directed and overseen by an interagency team of federal climate model experts, chaired by the
          U.S. Global Change Research Program. Federal agencies that partnered in this effort are the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), NASA, NOAA, and the
          U.S. Geological Survey (team members identified below).
        </p>
        <p>
          Design and programming of the Climate Explorer were completed by HabitatSeven, FernLeaf Interactive, and the National Environmental Modeling and
          Analysis Center (NEMAC), at UNC-Asheville.
        </p>
        <p>
          Production and processing of the LOCA climate projection data was done through a collaborative effort supported by NCEI-Asheville, NEMAC, and the
          Northeast Regional Climate Center, at Cornell University. Jay Alder (USGS) designed the color palettes and plotted data ranges for the interactive maps,
          and created future minus present difference maps for the 'precipitation' and 'number of dry days' variables.
